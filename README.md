# GamingRoomSoftwareDesignDoc
Software design document for SNHU CS-230 project for a "client" named "The Gaming Room" for scaling a gaming application named "Draw it or Lose it."

1) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The Gaming Room is a gaming company who wanted to develop a web-based game based on their current game "Draw it or Lose it." The game is currently available as an Android app only. The Gaming Room wants their game to scaled to multiple platforms, and allow users on different platforms to be able to play with eachother via multiplayer.

2) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

    In developing this documentation, I believe I did a great job with developing and explaining a plan for expaning this application on different platforms. This allows the client to understand how we plan on expaning their game to different platforms, and what exactly they are investing in.
   
3) What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    Designing this document allowed me to get more of a grasp of what our clients needs were. This also allowed me to think though on how each of the clients needs would need to be coded into the application by creating a URL to plan out and describe the logic. Creating this document also allowed me to understand how each type of OS works, and what the best OS would be to delvelop each application.
   
4) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    If I could choose something that I could improve on in the document, it would be the table that explains the differences between the major OS's. To improve upon the table, I would remove it completely. I feel that the table does not allow you to describe all of the benefits and faults of each OS in detail, as you could only provide a few sentences for each category.
   
6) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    I interpreted the users needs by creating a UML document that outlined what classes would be needed to create the application. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing an application because it can influence the users experience in a positive way. If users enjoy their experience, then it is likely that those users will promote your application, which increases overall revenue.
   
7) How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

       My approach for designing the software was an object oriented approach. It is important to create code that can be read, maintained, and improved upon by other developers in the future. Because of this, it is important for all code to be written with OOP principals. In the future, I will always use an OOP approach when creating a new program or application so that understanding and debugging the code will be more efficient!
